# QFullscreenFrame
A portable component that allows you to display other widgets overlaid on the outer frame without changing the placement of Widgets in the Fullscreen state

## Summary

such as toolbars with overlapping coordinates without vibration of the main window.

Frames can be displayed at the top or bottom of the screen.
It closes automatically when the mouse cursor leaves the frame.

WindowSystem's own title bar can be displayed on the frame(call showMaximized()).
Minimize, return to normal, close buttons are replaced with appropriate actions, respectively.
